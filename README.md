### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm [Pedro](https://www.rug.nl/staff/p.m.santos.neves/), I work in the [High Performance Computing team](https://www.rug.nl/staff/departments/20025) of the Center for Information Technology, University of Groningen. There, I mostly work supporting and training users of the [HÃ¡brÃ³k HPC](https://wiki.hpc.rug.nl/habrok/start), and on maintaining and developing new features for the cluster.

Half of my work time is dedicated to the [EESSI](https://eessi.io) project, an effort to build and distribute an optimized scientific software stack to HPC sites and other systems. The EESSI project is part of the [MultiXscale Center of Excellence](https://multixscale.eu), funded by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking.

I have also worked as a scientific programmer at the [Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences](https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/?lang=en), and before that I was a PhD student in theoretical evolutionary biology at the [Universty of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/tres/). I studied the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of communities on island systems and [graduated](https://doi.org/10.33612/diss.1127273367) in 2024.
