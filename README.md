# Hi there 👋 I'm Pedro Neves

I’m a **High Performance Computing (HPC) specialist** at the [Center for Information Technology, University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/cit). My work focuses on supporting and training users of the [Hábrók HPC cluster](https://wiki.hpc.rug.nl/habrok/start), as well as maintaining and developing new features for the cluster.

### 🔬 Research & Projects
- **EESSI Project**: I dedicate half of my time to the [EESSI](https://eessi.io) initiative, which aims to build and distribute an optimized scientific software stack to HPC sites and other systems. EESSI is part of the [MultiXscale Center of Excellence](https://multixscale.eu), funded by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking.

- **Scientific Programming**: Previously, I worked as a scientific programmer at the [Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES)](https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/?lang=en).

- **PhD in Theoretical Evolutionary Biology**: obtained my PhD at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/tres/), where I studied the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of communities on island systems. You can read my dissertation [here](https://doi.org/10.33612/diss.1127273367).
